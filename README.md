# IEEE-Stock-analysis-Project
Project related to stock analysis. In this project my contribution is to make a ranking system of the companies stock data
by considering raise and fall in stock prices over a month(As it was a very big data i wasnt able to extend it more than a month)
Considering the consistency in the stock prices i ranked the companies based on standard deviation of stock prices.
